**CHAPTER 175 ZONING** 

**PART A.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS** 

**ARTICLEI             GENERALPROVISIONS** 

**175-1.   Title.** 

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Durham, New Hampshire." 

**175-2.   Authority.** 

This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by RSA 674:16, as amended, which provides for the local legislative body to adopt or amend a Zoning Ordinance under the Ordinance Enactment Procedure of RSA 675:2-5. 

**175-3.   Purpose.** 

The provisions of this chapter are intended to regulate the use of land for the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the residents of the Town of Durham, in accordance with RSA 674:17. This chapter is adopted in accordance with and in order to implement the Master Plan and other policies designed to promote the orderly growth of the Town of Durham. Among other purposes, this chapter is specifically adopted to preserve air and water quality; to conserve open space and agricultural resources; to encourage the installation and use of renewable energy systems and protect access to renewable energy sources; to protect natural and scenic resources from degradation; to provide for recreational needs; to protect life and property from flooding and other natural hazards; to preserve historic sites and structures; and to ensure that development is commensurate with the character and physical limitations of the land. Further, this chapter is designed to ensure that the timing, location and nature of new development takes into account  the  immediate  and  long-range  financial  impacts  of  proposed  uses  and  enhances  the achievement of the town's economic development goals. 

**175-4.   Applicability.** 

1. No land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected, structurally altered, enlarged, moved, or used unless such use or activity is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, except as provided in Section 175-5. 
1. No building permit shall be issued for any proposed use, construction or activity which is not in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Durham. 

**175-5.   Applicability to Governmental Uses including the University of New Hampshire.** 

The provisions of this chapter shall be advisory with respect to governmental uses as identified by RSA 674:54 including the University of New Hampshire (UNH) except as provided in C. below. 

1. The state agency, county, municipal agency, university, school district or other governmental entity identified in RSA 674:54 shall provide the Planning Board with written notification of any use of its property or facilities that constitutes a substantial change in use or a substantial new use.  This notification shall be provided to the Town Planner at least sixty (60) days prior to the start of construction and shall contain plans, specifications, and explanations of the proposed use and an assessment of the potential impacts of the use on the community.  The notification for any project involving the University of New Hampshire shall be in accordance with the adopted “Process for Coordination and Communication” between the University and the Town.  The Planning Board may hold a public hearing on the proposed use.  If a hearing is held, the hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the written notification and at least two (2) weeks after publication of a notice thereof in a paper of general circulation in the town. The purpose of such hearing shall be to bring to light possible problems of traffic circulation, parking, provision of utilities, the protection of persons and property or any other problems affecting the town or the neighborhood.  A representative of the governmental entity or UNH shall be present at the hearing to present the plans, specifications, and construction schedule, and to provide explanations.  The Planning Board may issue nonbinding written comments relative to conformity or nonconformity of the proposal with normally applicable land use regulations to the government entity or university within 30 days after the hearing, together with any recommendations for minimizing any adverse impacts of the project on the community. 
1. Any use of land or buildings for governmental or university purposes that is located on land or in buildings or structures that are not owned by the governmental entity or university but for which the entity acquires only the right to use, whether by rental, lease or other beneficial interest, may not be used for any other purpose not otherwise permitted by this chapter. 
1. Any use, construction, or development of land, buildings, or other facilities on governmentally owned or occupied land including UNH, that is not used for a governmental or university use as defined in RSA 674:54 shall comply with the provisions of this chapter including, but not limited to, the requirements for site plan review and the issuance of building and other permits. 

**175-5.1  Minimum Requirements.**   

The provisions of this chapter shall be construed to be the minimum requirements for the granting of any pertinent Town approvals. Compliance with these requirements, however, is not necessarily deemed sufficient for the granting of these approvals. All applicants must comply with all other applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, standards, and policies of the Town of Durham and of other governmental authorities. In particular, all applicants must comply with the Durham Site Plan Regulations and the Durham Subdivision Regulations which include specific requirements and provide for the reasonable judgment of the Planning Board in reviewing applications. 

Nothing herein shall prevent the condemnation of land or buildings for municipal purposes by the Town of Durham or for public or institutional use by any agency, department, institution or public corporation of the State of New Hampshire or of the United States.

   10) calendar days prior to the time of the public hearing by the Planning Board.  The sign shall remain on the property until the conclusion of the public hearing.  This sign shall be visible from the most heavily traveled street right-of-way adjacent to the property. The sign shall  state the  date  of the  public  hearing, the  time, the location  and  the  action to  be considered.

1. The Planning Board shall consider the application at its next regular meeting following the public notice process. 
1. Where development approval for a conditional use includes subdivision or site plan approval by the Planning Board, the application and review procedure for a conditional use permit shall  be  made  concurrently  and  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  specified  in  the Subdivision  Regulations  or  Site  Plan  Regulations  as  applicable  to  the  particular development. 
3. ***Approval of Application and Granting of Conditional Use Permit***.  At least five (5) members must vote in favor of the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit for an application to be approved.

In such an event, the resubmitted application shall follow the same procedures as the original and shall be treated as a new application. 

**175-23.  Approval Criteria.** 

1. ***Planning Board Decision Based on Findings***.  Every decision of the Planning Board pertaining to the granting, denial or amendment of a request for a conditional use permit shall be based upon findings of fact and conditions of approval. The findings of fact and conditions of approval shall be supported in the records of its proceedings. The criteria enumerated in Subsection C are required to be met in any matter upon which the Planning Board is required to pass under these regulations. A mere finding or recitation of the enumerated conditions unaccompanied by findings of specific fact shall be deemed not to be*** in compliance with these regulations. 
2. ***Burden  on  applicant***.   The  applicant  shall  bear  the  burden  of  persuasion,  through  the introduction of sufficient evidence, through testimony, or otherwise, that the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with this Article and will satisfy the specific requirements for the use contained in the ordinance. 
2. ***Criteria Required for Consideration of a Conditional Use Permit***.  A conditional use permit shall be granted only if the Planning Board determines that the proposal conforms to all of the following conditional use permit criteria (except for specific criteria that are deemed by the Planning Board to be not pertinent to the application): 
1. Site suitability: The site is suitable for the proposed use. This includes: 
1. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access for the intended use. 
1. The availability of adequate public services to serve the intended use including emergency services, pedestrian facilities, schools, and other municipal services. 
1. The absence of environmental constraints (floodplain, steep slope, etc.) or development of a plan to substantially mitigate the impacts of those constraints. 
1. The availability of appropriate utilities to serve the intended use including water, sewage disposal, stormwater disposal, electricity, and similar utilities. 
2. External impacts: The external impacts of the proposed use on abutting properties and the neighborhood shall be no greater than the impacts of adjacent existing uses or other uses permitted in the zone.  This shall include, but not be limited to, traffic, noise, odors, vibrations, dust, fumes, hours of operation, and exterior lighting and glare.  In addition, the location, nature, design, and height of the structure and its appurtenances, its scale with reference to its surroundings, and the nature and intensity of the use, shall not have an adverse effect on the surrounding environment nor discourage the appropriate and orderly development and use of land and buildings in the neighborhood. 
2. Character of the site development:  The proposed layout and design of the site shall not*** be incompatible with the established character of the neighborhood and shall mitigate any external impacts of the use on the neighborhood.  This shall include, but not be limited to, the relationship of the building to the street, the amount, location, and screening of off-street parking, the treatment of yards and setbacks, the buffering of adjacent properties, and provisions for vehicular and pedestrian access to and within the site. 
2. Character of the buildings and structures: The design of any new buildings or structures and the modification of existing buildings or structures on the site shall not*** be incompatible with the established character of the neighborhood.  This shall include, but not be limited to, the scale, height, and massing of the building or structure, the roof line, the architectural treatment of the front or street elevation, the location of the principal entrance, and the material and colors proposed to be used. 
5. Preservation of natural, cultural, historic, and scenic resources:  The proposed use of the site, including  all  related  development  activities,  shall  preserve  identified  natural,  cultural, historic, and scenic resources on the site and shall not degrade such identified resources on abutting properties.  This shall include, but not be limited to, identified wetlands, floodplains, ![](Aspose.Words.fd159608-e498-4901-9594-a11f711e28bc.004.png)significant wildlife habitat, stonewalls, mature tree lines, cemeteries, graveyards, designated historic buildings or sites, scenic views, and viewsheds. 
5. Impact on property values: The proposed use will not cause or contribute to a significant decline in property values of adjacent properties. 
5. Availability of Public Services & Facilities: Adequate and lawful facilities or arrangements for  sewage  disposal,  solid  waste  disposal,  water  supply,  utilities,  drainage,  and  other necessary public or private services, are approved or assured, to the end that the use will be capable of proper operation.  In addition, it must be determined that these services will not cause excessive demand on municipal services, including, but not limited to, water, sewer, waste disposal, police protection, fire protection, and schools. 
5. Fiscal impacts:  The proposed use will not have a negative fiscal impact on the Town unless the Planning Board determines that there are other positive community impacts that off-set the negative fiscal aspects of the proposed use.  The Planning Board’s decision shall be based upon an analysis of the fiscal impact of the project on the town.  The Planning Board may commission, at the applicant's expense, an independent analysis of the fiscal impact of the project on the town. 
4. ***Conditions of Approval.***  Conditional Use Permit approvals shall be subject to appropriate conditions where such conditions are shown to be necessary to further the objectives of this ordinance and the Master Plan, or which would otherwise allow the general conditions of this article to be satisfied.

1. ***Accommodation of Persons with a Recognized Physical Disability***.  The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from the dimensional standards of this ordinance without finding a hardship when reasonable accommodations are necessary to allow a person or persons with a recognized physical disability to reside in or regularly use the premises, provided that: 
1. Any variance granted under this paragraph shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance. 
1. In granting any variance under this paragraph, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may provide, in a finding included in the variance, that the variance shall survive only so long as the particular person has a continuing need to use the premises.

1. ***Nonconforming Status of Projects Under Construction***.  Any use of a building for which a building permit has been issued prior to the adoption or amendment of these regulations and the erection of which is in conformity with the plans submitted and approved for such permit, but that does not conform to the use provisions of these regulations, shall be a nonconforming use, and may be continued or modified in accordance with the following provisions.

A  building  or  structure  containing  a nonconforming use may be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered if said use is changed to a permitted use or a conditional use for which a conditional use permit has been issued and the building or structure completely conforms to the provisions of these regulations. 
1. ***Change of a Nonconforming Use to Another Nonconforming Use***.  A nonconforming use may,  upon  approval  and  issuance  of  a  conditional  use  permit,  be  changed  to  another nonconforming use of the same or a more-restricted use classification, if no structural alterations are made to the building or other structure provided that said new nonconforming use is less deleterious to the neighborhood, considering all factors, than was the previous nonconforming use. 

**175-29.  Nonconforming Lots.** 

1. ***Single, Vacant Nonconforming Lots***.

If the front wall of the building is located behind  the front property line, a paved sidewalk  or other appropriate pedestrian  way  shall  be  provided  from  the  sidewalk  to  the  front  door.   This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent the creation of other entrances to the building.  For corner lots, this provision shall apply only to the frontage on the street with a greater amount of pedestrian traffic.

The setback in (i) and (ii), above, also applies where they may be any intervening street or road that has never been built but which appears on an approved plat or other Town plan. 

4. The Planning Board must determine that the additional story will not have an adverse impact upon the streetscape, giving particular consideration to scale and mass (See Architectural Regulations for guidance). 
4. Building height.  When an additional story is incorporated under this section the  maximum building height is 60 feet.

1. For a building where there are distinct sections with a different number of stories  and  for  sites  where  there  are  multiple  buildings,  the  required minimum overall office/retail gross square footage is determined by the sum of the minimum office/retail area required by each distinct section, or by each separate building, using the required office retail space specified above.  For these sites, the disposition of office/retail and residential space on the site is flexible provided the minimum overall amount of office/retail required is included and the Planning Board determines that the configuration of the building and its uses meets the intent of this subsection 7. 
1. Outdoor public use areas.  Outdoor space on the subject property that is dedicated in perpetuity to public use may be used to meet the office/retail square  footage  requirement  on  a  one-to-one  basis  provided  that:  a)  the Planning Board determines that the design, location, management, and other aspects of the space will add a significant public amenity to the project; and b) the outdoor space may be used to meet a maximum of 50% of the overall required office/retail square footage.

1. Occupancy of Residences. See Section 175-56 A. regarding limitations on the number of unrelated occupants.***   
1. Junkyards. Junkyards are prohibited in all districts.
1. Untreated wastes. Untreated sewage or household wastes shall not be discharged into any flowing stream or body of water. Owners and users of land not served by town water and sewer shall be required to furnish plans for a satisfactory on-site sewage disposal system with percolation tests that indicate satisfactory drainage before a building permit will be issued, provided that such system satisfies all local and state ordinances, statutes and regulations. 
1. Inoperative motor vehicles. The outdoor storage of unregistered or inoperative motor vehicles shall be prohibited in all zones except as follows: 
1. Not more than one (1) such vehicle may be stored on any lot during any calendar year, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days except for lots used for permitted motor vehicle related businesses. 
1. The provisions of state law shall determine the storage period for abandoned, improperly registered or wrecked vehicles by any garage or other persons properly storing the same according to law. (See RSA 236.) 
5. Combination of uses. Any combination of uses contemplated as a single enterprise may be established in only those districts in which all such uses are permitted. Any establishment having combination of uses must meet all the requirements of each use as outlined by the Durham Zoning Ordinance. In the case of conflicting duly adopted rules, regulations or ordinances, the more restrictive shall apply. 
5. Airports and Heliports.  Private and commercial airports and heliports shall be prohibited in all Zoning Districts within the Town of Durham, unless otherwise expressly permitted in a Zoning District 
5. Number of bedrooms.  The maximum number of bedrooms in any dwelling unit in any “Residence,  Multi-unit”  or  “Mixed  Use  with  Residential  (office/retail  down,  multi-unit residential up)” shall be four. 
5. Basement units.  No new basement dwelling unit, nor any unit that is partially below grade, shall be permitted in any “Residence, Multi-unit” or “Mixed Use with Residential (office/retail down, multi-unit residential up)” building. 
5. Accessory uses and structures.  Accessory uses and structures are permitted for all uses in all zones as defined in this ordinance except as otherwise specifically prohibited in the Table of Uses and elsewhere in this ordinance. Site plan review, issuance of a building permit, and other permitting is required for all accessory uses and structures in similar manner as for all principle uses and structures. 

**175-56.   General Dimensional Standards.** 

1. Limitation on number of unrelated occupants.  Within the following zoning districts, any dwelling unit consisting of an unrelated household shall contain no more than three (3) unrelated occupants: 
1. Rural (R) 
1. Residence A (RA) 
1. Residence B (RB) 
1. Residence C (RC)  
1. Central Business District (CB) 
1. Professional Office (PO) 
1. Church Hill (CH)  
1. Courthouse (C) and  
1. Coe’s Corner (CC)  

(Note that there may be more restrictive occupancy requirements than these under the New Hampshire State Building Code and Fire Code and the Durham Rental Housing Ordinance.) 

2. Minimum floor area per occupant in unrelated household.  The minimum required habitable floor area per occupant in an unrelated household is shown in Table 175-56 below.  (See definition for “Household.”). 

**Table 175-56. MINIMUM HABITABLE FLOOR AREA BY DWELLING TYPE FOR UNRELATED HOUSEHOLD**

**Minimum habitable floor area per occupant in** 

**DWELLING TYPE  unrelated household** Single-family dwelling  300 

Duplex or townhouse  300 Apartment (but not including apartments in the CB District as  400 

delineated in Section 175-42(B)(8) and (9), accessory apartments 

and apartments in the ORLI and MUDOR districts). 

Apartment in the Central Business District (excluding apartments  300 in the CB District as delineated in Section 175-42(B)(8) and (9) 

and accessory apartments) where the number of unrelated 

occupants does not exceed two                                                      

Apartment in the CB District located in a building within the  250 area of the district delineated in Section 175-42 (B) (8) and (9) 

where the maximum height of three stories applies 

Apartment  in the ORLI and MUDOR districts (but not             200 including accessory apartments) 

Accessory Apartment  200 Rooming/boarding, including accessory rooming/boarding  150 Dormitory  100 Fraternity or sorority  150 Nursing home  150 

Senior housing  200 (Note that there may be more restrictive occupancy requirements than these under the New Hampshire State Building Code and Fire Code and the Durham Rental Housing Ordinance.) 

3. **Building height**.  The height of the building may not exceed the maximum permitted height.  
1. Measuring height.  Building height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the mean elevation of the finish grade, six feet offset from the building foundation (or at the property line if the building is less than six feet from the property line), around the perimeter of the building to the following points for the various roof types shown: 
1. gable, hip, and curved roofs:  the midpoint between the ridge/high point and the corresponding eave;  
1. gambrel and mansard-type roofs and roofs that are fully dormered:  the deck or curb line (the top of the lower roof slope) or the eave above the dormer for fully dormered roofs; 
1. flat roofs (including those with parapets) and situations where there is no discernible roof (such as the higher wall under a shed roof):  the eave, cornice, or fascia at the top of the wall. 
2. Appurtenant elements.  Cupolas and towers with an area of 100 square feet or less and roof-mounted appurtenances such as solar arrays, utilities, roof decks, and  telecommunications structures are not considered part of the building height.  However, these elements may not exceed the maximum permitted building height by more than 15 feet (unless otherwise explicitly permitted). 
3. Additions.  For new building additions, the mean grade elevation shall be measured around the addition only. 
3. Difference in elevation.  Where there is more than an eight foot difference in elevation between the highest and lowest points along the finish grade, six feet offset from the building foundation around the perimeter of the building, the mean elevation shall be calculated separately for appropriate sections or sides of the building. 
3. Excavations.  Where an area is excavated adjacent to the foundation to provide a light well or outdoor use area for a lower level, such that the excavated area would not be prominently visible from any property line, the grade may be measured to the ground surface beyond the excavated area. 
3. Spot elevations.  Measurements of the elevation of the grade around the foundation may be taken at specific points as directed by the zoning administrator. 
4. ***Permitted uses in setback areas.***   
1. No building is permitted within the setback areas specified for the zoning district.  However, accessory structures (not including driveways and parking areas) for residential uses may occupy up to 30 percent of a front, side, or rear setback area provided they are set back at least 10 feet from any lot line and do not exceed 20 feet in height.   
1. All setback areas, except for driveways, walkways, and permitted structures, shall be landscaped or left with natural vegetation. 
5. ***Corner  clearance***.  No  object,  vegetation  or  slope  which  impedes  visibility  at  street intersections shall be allowed within a triangle, two (2) of whose sides extend twenty (20) feet from the intersection along the street lines and between two (2) planes three (3) feet and seven 
   7) feet above the level of the traveled way. 
5. ***Changes in lot dimensions***.  Any change made to the dimensions of an undeveloped lot shall meet all the requirements of this Article in effect at the time of the proposed change. In the case of a legal nonconforming lot which has been developed, the lot dimensions may be changed to decrease the violation of the dimensional requirements of this chapter. 
5. ***Calculation of usable area.***  The usable area of a parcel of land shall be determined by subtracting the following unsuitable areas from the gross area of the parcel.  A High Intensity Soil Survey (HISS) shall be used to determine the unusable areas of soils set forth below.  The unsuitable areas shall be deducted in the following order and no geographic area shall be deducted more than once:

All buildings and structures shall be erected, altered, enlarged, or moved and all land within (or in the case of septic setbacks, below, to proximity to) the WCOD shall be used in accordance with the following performance standards: 

1. ***Naturally Vegetated Buffer Strip*** 

   A naturally vegetated buffer strip meeting the requirements of 175-75.1 of the Shoreland Protection Overlay District shall be maintained from the reference line of each wetland to the upland limit of the WCOD.  Where existing buildings or structures or other site considerations preclude the maintenance of a vegetated buffer for the full width of the upland portion of the WCOD, a buffer of the maximum possible width as set forth in 175- 75.1 shall be provided.  No soil disturbance shall occur within fifty (50) feet of the reference line.  Existing lawns within the upland buffer may be allowed to remain provided that a twenty-five (25) foot wide strip adjacent to the reference line of the wetland is not mowed and is allowed to reestablish naturally occurring vegetation.  The application of fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides within the buffer strip shall be prohibited except in conjunction with allowed agricultural activities. 

2. ***Sedimentation and Erosion Control*** 

   All activities and the use of buildings, structures, and land within the WCOD shall be designed and operated to minimize the volume and rate of stormwater runoff, the amount of erosion, and the export of sediment from the site.  All activities shall be conducted in accordance  with  Town  standards  for  stormwater  management  and  Best  Management Practices (BMPs) for stormwater management including but not limited to: 

1. Best Management Practices to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution: A Guide for Citizens and Town Officials, NHDES, January 2004

3. ***Agricultural Activity*** 

   No soil disturbance, manure spreading, or mowing in conjunction with either commercial agriculture or accessory agricultural activities shall occur within the wetland or within seventy-five (75) feet of the reference line of the wetland.  Commercial agriculture within the WCOD (except for aquaculture when approved under 175-60B and by the appropriate state agency) shall be conducted in accordance with a management plan approved by the Strafford  County  Resource  Conservation  District  as  demonstrating  Best  Management Practices as set forth in “Manual of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Agriculture in New Hampshire” 2017, as amended (New Hampshire Department of Agriculture) and “Best Management Wetlands Practices for Agriculture,” as amended (New Hampshire Department of Agriculture)   

4. ***Forestry*** 

   Any forestry activity~~ within the WCOD shall be in accordance with the Basal Area Law RSA  227-J:9  and  shall  use  as  guidance  for  best  forest  management  practices  “New Hampshire  Best  Management  Practices  for  Erosion  Control  on  Timber  Harvesting Operations” Department of Resources and Economic Development and University of New Hampshire  Cooperative  Extension  2016,  as  amended;  Best  Management Practices  for Forestry: Protecting New Hampshire’s Water Quality 2005 as amended; and “Good Forestry in the Granite State” (DRED). 

5. ***Trails*** 

   Trails within the WCOD shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with Best Management Practices as set forth in “”Best Management Practices for Erosion Control During Trail Maintenance and Construction” (DRED 1994).  The use of trails within the WCOD shall be limited to non-motorized activities except when the trail is snow covered. 

6. ***Septic Setbacks*** 

   Any new septic system, leach field, or other sewage disposal system shall be set back 125 feet from the reference line of the wetland or as provided for in 175-139, whichever is greater. 

The replacement of an existing septic system, leach field, or other sewage disposal system that is located within the required setback from the reference line of the wetland shall comply with the required setback unless the Health Officer/Zoning Administrator/Code Enforcement Officer determines that such a location is not physically possible due to the shape  or  size  of  the  lot  and  soil  conditions.   If  the  Health  Officer/Zoning Administrator/Code Enforcement Officer determines that a replacement system must be located within the required wetland septic system setback, the system shall be located to provide  the  maximum  setback  possible  as  determined  by  the  Health  Officer/Zoning Administrator/Code Enforcement Officer and shall employ the best available technology. 

**175-66.  Challenge to the Classification of Wetlands.** 

If the classification of an area as a wetland or not as a wetland or the location of the reference line is challenged by the applicant, an abutter, a landowner, the Code Enforcement Officer, the Conservation Commission, or the Planning Board, petition shall be made, in writing, by the challenger to the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall engage a state certified wetlands scientist*** to review the wetland delineation.  If the wetlands scientist determines that there is uncertainty as to the classification of an area as a wetland or the location of the reference line, the Zoning Administrator may authorize the wetlands scientist to conduct an on-site investigation.  The wetlands scientist shall present evidence in written form to the Zoning Administrator, which evidence shall form the basis for the final decision.  The cost for the review of the classification shall be borne by the challenger unless the Planning Board determines that the review is in the greater public interest and the cost should therefore be borne by the Town. 

**175-67.  Responsibility for Restoration of Altered Wetlands.** 

Any wetland altered in violation of this article shall be restored at the expense of the violator(s), as provided by RSA 483-A:5. 

**175-68.  Local Authority and Variances.** 

No approval or waiver of permits by state or federal agencies shall preempt the ability of the Planning Board or the Zoning Board of Adjustment to seek additional information or to make an independent judgment as to the acceptability of a lot or alteration of land.

If  the  Health  Officer/Zoning Administrator/Code Enforcement Officer determines that a replacement system must be located within the required shoreland septic system setback, the system shall be located to provide the maximum setback possible as determined by the Zoning Administrator and shall employ the best available technology. 

3. ***Use of Shoreland in Calculating Lot Area and Density*** 

Land within the SPOD may be used to meet the minimum lot area, minimum lot size, or maximum density provisions of the underlying zoning. 

4. ***Shoreland Frontage*** 

Any single lot that abuts a waterbody in the SPOD shall have a minimum of two hundred (200) feet of shoreland frontage except in zoning districts where a lesser length of frontage or none is specified in the Table of Dimensions.  If such a lot contains more than one dwelling unit and is served by on-site sewage disposal, the lot shall have an additional fifty (50) feet of shoreland frontage per dwelling unit. 

**175-75.  Coordination with Other Districts** 

All land within the SPOD is also subject to the provisions of the underlying zone.  Where there is conflict among the provisions of the SPOD, any other applicable overlay district, and the underlying district, the most restrictive or stringent provision shall apply. 

**175-76.  Performance Standards in the SPOD** 

All buildings and structures shall be erected, altered, enlarged, or moved and all land within the SPOD** shall be used in accordance with the** following specific performance standards: 

1. ***Natural Woodland for Shoreland Development***  

The preservation of natural  shoreland vegetation is  intended to  stabilize banks  to prevent  erosion,  maintain  wildlife  habitats,  minimize  pollution  of  the  water  and preserve the scenic quality of shoreline properties. 

Where existing, a natural woodland buffer shall be maintained within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the reference line or for the full width of the SPOD if the district is less than one hundred fifty (150) feet in width.  The purpose of this buffer shall be to protect the quality of public waters by minimizing erosion, preventing siltation and turbidity, stabilizing  soils,  preventing  excess  nutrients  and  chemical  pollution,  maintaining natural  water  temperatures,  maintaining  a  healthy  tree  canopy  and  understory, preserving fish and wildlife habitat, and respecting the overall natural conditions of the protected shoreland.  

Where a natural woodland buffer does not exist, a naturally vegetated buffer strip at least fifty (50) feet in width, or the full width of the SPOD if the district is less than fifty (50) feet in width, shall be maintained adjacent to the reference line. Within the buffer strip, naturally occurring vegetation shall be maintained and encouraged.  No new lawn, garden, or landscape areas shall be created within the buffer strip but existing lawns may be allowed to remain provided that a twenty-five (25) foot wide strip adjacent to the shore is not mowed and is allowed to reestablish naturally occurring vegetation. 

Within the buffer, the following standards shall apply: 

1. Selective cutting of trees and other vegetation other than ground cover shall be permitted provided that a healthy, well distributed stand of trees and other vegetation is maintained.  No trees over six (6) inches in DBH [nineteen (19) inches in circumference] shall be cut within the natural woodland buffer.  Not more than fifty (50) percent of the basal area of trees, nor more than fifty (50) percent of the total number of saplings shall be removed in any twenty (20) year period.  A healthy, well distributed stand of trees, saplings, shrubs and ground covers and their living undamaged root systems shall be left in place. 
1. Existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height including ground cover shall not be removed except to provide for a single point of access to the shoreline as provided for in G. below, and in case of disease as provided for in 5. below. 
1. No cleared opening in the forest canopy shall be created with a projected surface area of greater than two hundred fifty (250) square feet as measured from the outer limits of the tree crown unless a building is allowed within the buffer strip.  In such case, a cleared opening for the building site may be created but the cleared opening shall not extend more than twenty-five (25) feet outward from the building. 
1. Stumps and their root systems which are located within fifty (50) feet of the reference  line  shall  be  left  intact.   The  removal  of  stumps  and  roots  in conjunction with beaches or docks may be permitted with the approval of the Conservation Commission based upon a determination that the removal in combination  with  mitigation  activities  will  not  increase  the  potential  for erosion. 
1. Dead, diseased, or damaged trees, saplings, or ground covers may be removed with prior approval of the Conservation Commission, in consultation with the Tree Warden.  The stumps and root systems of the removed trees shall not be disturbed and shall remain in place. If such removal results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native species unless existing new growth is present.  Dead and living trees that provide dens and nesting places for wildlife are encouraged to be preserved. 
6. The application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers within the buffer is prohibited except in conjunction with allowed agricultural activities.  In the case of allowed agriculture, no fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides shall be applied within seventy-five (75) feet of the reference line. 
2. ***Agriculture*** 

In no case shall any soil disturbance or animal grazing occur within seventy-five (75) feet of the reference line.  No fertilizers (including manure), pesticides, or herbicides shall be applied within seventy-five (75) feet of the reference line.  Any commercial agricultural activity within the SPO (except for aquaculture when approved under 175- 60B and by the appropriate state agency) shall be conducted in accordance with a management plan approved by the Strafford County Natural Resources Conservation Service as demonstrating Best Management Practices. 

3. ***Forestry*** 

Any forestry activity within the SPO shall be conducted in accordance with ~~a~~ forest management plan prepared by a New Hampshire state licensed professional forester and shall be in accordance with the Basal Area Law RSA 227-J:9 and shall use as guidance for best forest management practices “New Hampshire Best Management Practices  for  Erosion  Control  on  Timber  Harvesting  Operations”  Department  of Resources and Economic Development and University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension 2016, as amended, Best Management Practices for Forestry: Protecting New Hampshire’s Water Quality 2005 as “Good Forestry in the Granite State” (DRED).  In no case shall any harvesting or clearing, except for the removal of dead or diseased trees, occur within fifty (50) feet of the reference line.  If there is conflict among the standards, the most restrictive shall apply. 

4. ***Sedimentation and Erosion Control*** 

All activities and the use of buildings, structures, and land within the SPOD shall be designed and operated to minimize the volume and rate of stormwater runoff, the amount of erosion, and the export of sediment from the site, and to prevent the release of surface runoff across exposed mineral soils.  All activities shall be carried out in accordance with a stormwater management and erosion control plan that incorporates Best Management Practices** and is approved by the Strafford County Natural Resources Conservation Service.** 

5. ***Inspection of Nonconforming Septic Systems*** 

When a property with a septic system that does not conform to the setback requirements of 175-74.B is sold or otherwise transferred,** the septic system shall be inspected by the Town’s Code Enforcement Officer and, if inadequate, replaced prior to the transfer of the property.  If it is replaced it shall be consistent with the setback requirements in 175-74, unless deemed by the Code Enforcement Officer to be unreasonable due to the site or soil conditions. 

6. ***Access to the Shorefront***  

One point of access to the shorefront may be developed on any lot.  Such access shall be limited to a maximum of twenty (20) feet in width. 

7. ***Docks and Piers In or Over the Water*** 

If otherwise permitted in the District, a maximum of ten (10) percent of the frontage of the lot on the waterbody, but no greater than fifty (50) feet of frontage may be used for a boat dock or ramp (excluding seasonal, temporary docks or ramps).  Access to the facility shall be located on soils suitable for such use and shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize erosion.  The facility shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements.  

**ARTICLE XV                         FLOODHAZARDOVERLAYDISTRICT** 

**175-77.  Applicability.** 

1. **Purpose** 

Certain areas of the Town of Durham, New Hampshire are subject to periodic flooding, causing serious damages to properties within these areas. Relief is available in the form of flood insurance as authorized by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.  Therefore, the Town of Durham, New Hampshire has chosen to become a participating community in the National Flood Insurance Program, and agrees to comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended) as detailed in this Floodplain Management Ordinance. 

The following regulations in this ordinance shall apply to all lands designated as special flood hazard areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its "Flood Insurance Study for the County of Strafford, N.H." dated September 30, 2015, together with the following associated Flood Insurance Rate Map panel numbers for the Town of Durham: 33017C0314E, 33017C0315E,  33017C0318E,  33017C0320E,  33017C0340E,  33017C0376E,  33017C0377E, 33017C0378E,  33017C0379E,  33017C0381E,  33017C0383E,  33017C0385E,  33017C0405E, dated September 30, 2015, which are declared to be a part of this ordinance and are hereby incorporated by reference. 

Advisory Climate Change Risk Areas.  As a coastal community with significant waterfront property along Great Bay, Little Bay, and tidal portions of the Oyster River, the Town of Durham recognizes the future threats that climate change and projected sea level rise pose to the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. The Town of Durham, in its “Vulnerability Assessment of projected impacts from sea-level rise and coastal storm surge flooding” identified areas likely to be at risk to coastal flooding in the future under projections for rising sea-levels associated with global climate change. These areas may be subject to a higher likelihood of flood damage, and as base flood elevations change over time, may be added to FEMA special flood hazard areas in the future.  The map titled “Advisory Climate Change Risk Areas” dated February 21, 2018 (for moderate level projected rise of 3.9 feet, as referred to on the map under Map Feature Notes) is declared to be an advisory and non-binding part of this ordinance and is hereby incorporated by reference. The Town of Durham recommends (but does not require) that landowners, homeowners, developers, and any parties seeking to build in lands designated as advisory climate change risk areas elevate proposed structures to the levels, and follow best practices, as presented herein.  See subsection 175-83 C. below. 

2. **Building Permit Required.** 

All proposed development in any special flood hazard area shall require a building permit. 

**175-78.  General Design Standards.** 

The Code Enforcement Officer shall review all building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction or substantial improvements shall be: 

1. Be designed or modified, and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
1. Use flood damage-resistant materials for building components located below the base flood elevation. 
1. Be reasonably safe from flooding and be designed and constructed with methods, practices and materials that minimize flood damage. 
1. Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 

**175-79.  Water and Sewer Systems.** 

Where new or replacement water and sewer systems, including on-site systems, are proposed in special  flood  hazard  areas,  the  applicant  shall  provide  the  Code  Enforcement  Officer  with assurance that these systems will be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and on-site waste-disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during periods of flooding. 

**175-80.  Certification Records.** 

The Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request any certifications of flood proofing and the as-built elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures and include whether or not such structures contain a basement. If the structure has been flood proofed, the as-built elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which the structure was flood proofed must be furnished by the applicant. 

**175-81.  Review of Proposed Developments.** 

The Code Enforcement Officer shall review proposed developments to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal  or  state  law,  including  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C.S. 1334.

**ARTICLE XVI**  

**AQUIFER PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT** 

**175-84. Authority and Purpose.**  

Pursuant to RSA 674:16-21, the Town of Durham adopts an Aquifer Protection Overlay District and accompanying regulations in order to protect, preserve and maintain existing and potential groundwater supplies and related groundwater recharge areas within the town. The objectives of the Aquifer Protection Overlay District are:  

1. To protect the public health and general welfare of the citizens of Durham.  
1. To prevent development and land use practices that could potentially contaminate or reduce the rate of recharge of identified aquifers.  
1. To provide for future growth and development of the town, in accordance with the Master Plan, by ensuring the future availability of safe public and private water supplies.  
1. To permit uses that can appropriately and safely be located in the aquifer recharge areas.  

**175-85. District Boundaries.**  

1. ***Location***.  
1. The Aquifer Protection Overlay District is defined as the area shown on the map entitled "Aquifer Protection District" and is hereby adopted as part of the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Durham. The Aquifer Protection Overlay District includes the area delineated by the 1988-89 United States Geological Survey aquifer delineation studies, as amended or updated, and other site-specific engineering studies.  
1. The  Aquifer  Protection  Overlay  District  is  a  zoning  overlay  district  which  imposes additional requirements and restrictions to those of the underlying district. In all cases, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.  
2. ***Appeals***.  
1. When the actual boundary of the Aquifer Protection Overlay District is in dispute by any landowner or abutter actually affected by said boundary or the location of the boundary is challenged by an applicant, an abutter, a landowner, the Code Enforcement Officer, the Conservation Commission, or the Planning Board, petition shall be made, in writing, by the challenger to the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator shall engage a Qualified Hydrogeologist to prepare a report addressing the location and extent of the aquifer and recharge area relative to the property in question, and the location of the overlay district boundary.  The cost for the review shall be borne by the challenger unless the Planning Board determines that the review is in the general public interest and the cost should therefore be borne by the Town.  Any appeals must address a minimum of five (5) acres or an entire lot, whichever is lesser in area.  This report shall include but not be limited to the following:  
1. A two-foot-interval topographic layout prepared by a registered land surveyor of the property(s) in question.  
1. A high-intensity soils map of the property(s) in question prepared by a Certified Soil Scientist qualified in hydrologic studies, including a written report of the scientist’s on-site field inspection and test boring data, for all** test borings and test pits taken.  The professional seal of the Certified Soil Scientist shall be affixed to all maps and reports submitted. 
1. The Aquifer Protection Overlay District boundary shall be overlaid on the plat, and the newly proposed boundary location shall be indicated on the same plat by a broken line.  
1. Evidence derived from a pumping test(s) and a sufficient number of test borings, test pits, observation wells and groundwater elevations to clearly demonstrate that the area in question does not meet the definition of "Aquifer" or "Aquifer Recharge Area" as defined  under  Article  II  of  this  ordinance.   All  evidence  must  be  gathered  in accordance with Section 175-87. 
1. Any  additional  mapping,  hydrogeologic  reports  or  information  which  becomes available as a result of recent or ongoing scientific investigation(s) of the locations and extent of aquifers performed by this United States Geological Survey, New Hampshire State agencies or boards, the Town of Durham or agents of any of the above.  
2. The Planning Board may, based upon any findings or reports submitted under this section, recommend to the Town Council of the Town of Durham that the boundary or area designation of the Aquifer Protection Overlay District be adjusted to more correctly define the aquifer(s) and recharge area(s) on a site-specific, case-by-case basis.  In all cases the burden of proof shall rest with the applicant or property owner. 

**175-86. Use Regulations.**  

1. ***Minimum lot size***. The minimum lot size shall be governed by the dimensional controls outlined in the applicable zoning district.

**175-92.  Designation of Historic District** 

1. ***Procedures for Designation*.** The** (HOD) District exists as a zoning overlay district.  The District boundaries may be amended and new historic districts may be designated and delineated following the Amendment Procedure described in Article IV, Section 175-14 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
1. ***Criteria for Designation*.**  The following criteria should be considered when the Commission, Planning Board, and Town Council deliberate the enlargement or reduction of an existing district or the creation of a new district. In any district which contains multiple properties or structures, not every property or structure need meet these criteria. Rather, the district overall should embody a significant degree of continuity, cohesiveness, integrity, and conformity with one or more of the following criteria. 
1. The  site  is  identified  with  or  significantly  represents  or  exemplifies  one  or  more significant cultural, social, political, economic, or military events in the history of the Town of Durham, region, state, or nation. 
1. The site is associated with a person or persons of historic significance. 
1. The  site  embodies  distinguishing  characteristics  of,  or  quality  in,  design,  detailing, materials, craftsmanship, or a particular architectural style.  
4. The site is identified as the work or representing the work of a master builder, designer, architect, engineer, or landscape architect whose individual work was influential in the development of the town, region, state, or nation. 
4. The site’s unique location and characteristics make it an established and appreciated element or visual landmark for the community. 
4. The site’s age, good condition, and special features make it worthy of preservation. 
4. The site has yielded or is likely to yield significant archaeological information. 
4. The site contributes to the visual continuity of the District. 

**175-93.  Identification of the Historic Overlay District.** 

A Zoning Map of the HOD as amended, including all the notations, references, district boundaries, and other information shown thereon, is incorporated by reference as part of this Ordinance and is on file with the Town Clerk.  If there are any inconsistencies between the map and the listing of map and lot numbers under subsection (B), the listing of map and lot numbers herein shall prevail. 

1. ***Locating Boundaries*.**  The District lines drawn on the HOD map are generally on or parallel to a street, watercourse, or lot line, and shall, unless there are indications to the contrary, be deemed to be: 
1. On the centerline of the right-of-way or watercourse; 
1. Parallel to the centerline at the distance noted; or 
1. On the lot line, or parallel to the lot line, at the distance noted in Section B. 
2. ***Delineation of the District*.**  The HOD is defined as that area made up of the lots listed below, including those that are Town-owned lots, as delineated on the Durham Tax Maps,*** excluding road rights of way. However, any buildings or portions of buildings or stone walls or portions of stone walls that are located in any road right of way within the boundaries of the HOD shall be subject to review by the HDC. Except as otherwise specified, all of the land composing each lot shall be considered to lie within the District. The precise location, on the ground, of the historic district boundary will remain in place and not be affected simply by a change in the location of any lot line as a result of a future subdivision, lot line adjustment, or lot merger. 
1. Map 4: Lots 1-0, 50-0 (including only the westerly portion as delineated on the Zoning Overlay Map and as originally identified as Lots 52 and 53), 54-2 (Episcopal Church), 54-3, 54-4***,*** 55-0, 56-0, and 59-0. 
1. Map 5: Lots 1-4 1-5, 1-6, 1-9, 1-10***,*** 1-12, 2-1 through 2-8 inclusive, 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 4-2 [seventy-five (75) feet from the centerline of Newmarket Road], 4-10, 4-12, 5-10, 5-11, 

   5-12, 5-14, 6-6, and 7-0. 

3. Map 6: Lots 9-1 through 9-5 inclusive, 9-6, 9-6-1, 9-8, and 9-8-1 [for all four lots, two hundred fifty (250) feet from the centerline of Newmarket Road], 9-7, 9-9, 11-0, 11-1, 11-2, 11-3 [two hundred fifty (250) feet from the centerline of Newmarket Road and Durham Point Road], 11-4, 11-5, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-8 [both lots, two hundred fifty (250) feet from the centerline of Newmarket Road]  and 12-1 through 12-8 inclusive, including 12-3A.   
3. Map 11: Lot 34-1 [two hundred fifty (250) feet from the centerline of Durham Point Road, located to the west of Lot 15-17-1]*** 
3. Map 15: Lot 17-1*** 

**175-94.  Purview of Board.** 

1. ***Activity Within the Historic District Overlay District Subject to Review.***  Approval of the HDC is required for the following activity within the HOD: 
1. Modifications to the exterior architectural appearance (See definition) of the property including  erection  of  new  structures  (See  definition  for  “Structure”  in  the  Historic District), additions to existing structures, alterations to existing structures, demolition of existing structures or portions of existing structures, or relocation of any structure into, out of, or within the HOD. 
1. Installation, modification, or removal of exterior freestanding lighting structures. 
1. Erection, alteration, or removal of any kind of wall, barrier or fence. 
1. Installation of pavement or other impervious or semi-impervious material on the ground or establishment of any parking or driveway area.  
1. Installation of any new roofing material where the material, form, or color will change significantly. However, where failure to repair a roof will result in immediate damage to the structure the Code Enforcement Officer may grant approval for emergency temporary repairs and immediately notify the HDC, which will then review the work at its next opportunity (unless exempt under Section B., below) 
1. Signage, except  for temporary signs (See Subsection 175-126.C), such  as political, contractor, and real estate signs.  See section on Signage, below, for special provisions.***  
1. Removal or destruction of any healthy tree with a diameter at breast height (4-1/2 feet above grade) of 12" or more.  
1. Any substantial change in topography (cuts and fills).  
9. Building and ground-mounted utilities and roof penetrations that would be visible from a public street within the Historic District at any time of the year. 
9. Where only a portion of a building, whether existing or proposed, is located in the Historic District, the entire building and any proposed additions or alterations to any part of that building shall be subject to review.** 
2. ***Activity Exempt from Review*.**  No review or Certificate of Approval shall be required for the following: 
1. Work performed on the interior of buildings. 
1. General maintenance and in-kind repair which does not involve any significant change in materials or the outward appearance of the structure or site. Alternative materials may be  used  for  general  maintenance  when  the  material  and  its  application  have  been preapproved by the HDC. See the Historic District Regulations for acceptable alternative materials. 
1. Installation or removal of any plant materials (except for tree removal as described in 175-94.A.7).  
1. Any of the following items if they are situated on a building or on a lot such that no part of them will be visible from a public street within the Historic District at any time of the year: antenna, wall siding, a change in roofing material, outbuilding not exceeding 400 square feet, deck, swimming pool, fence, patio, wall, barbecue pit, satellite dish, solar panels, roof vents and other structures situated on or penetrating through the roof, septic tank, leach field, well, any other utilities, and other yard appurtenances. 
1. Construction, alteration, or demolition of any structure or element of a structure that the Code Enforcement Officer certifies as being the only means of avoiding an immediate health or safety emergency prior to the HDC convening a meeting to consider the matter.  In  such  an  instance,  the  Code  Enforcement  Officer  shall  immediately  notify  the Commission of*** his or her certification.  The HDC may review such work at its first opportunity if it deems appropriate.*** 
1. Painting or staining a building when the color will not change. 
1. Colors of paint and stain applied to a single-family house. 
1. Flagpoles, mailboxes, window air conditioning units in a single-family residence or accessory apartment, utility poles.  
1. Installation of any new roofing material where the material, form, or color will not change significantly. 
10. Items which are not explicitly addressed in this subsection but for which the proposed work clearly:  
1. would not have any significant adverse impact;  
1. would be barely noticeable, if at all, from any public street; and  
1. would be consistent with the intent of this article, all as reasonably determined by the Planning Department in consultation with the HDC chair. 

**175-95.  Procedures For Review Of A Certificate Of Approval.** 

1. ***Application:***  In order to be considered at the next scheduled HDC meeting, an application for a  Certificate  of  Approval  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Durham  HDC  through  the  Planning Department no fewer than 10 days prior to that meeting. When the deadline would fall on a weekend or holiday, the application must be submitted by the next workday.  In the case of a special meeting, the chair may allow for a shorter timeframe for submission of materials.  Applications must be emailed, postmarked, or hand delivered to Town Hall by midnight on the day of the deadline.  
1. **Application materials**.  The application package shall include the items listed below, when applicable: 
1. Application  Form.   A  completed  application  form  as  provided  by  the  Planning Department.***  
1. Site  Plans.  Site  plans drawn  to  scale  clearly  depicting  existing  conditions  and proposed work.  If topographic plans will be required as part of a site plan review, then the plans shall be submitted if the HDC determines that they would be helpful to review.  For other projects, at the HDC’s discretion, particularly where there is a significant change in grade over the site or in the vicinity of the proposed new building, the applicant shall provide topographic plans.  Where topographic plans are submitted they shall show the existing grades and finish grades at the foundation and within 10 feet of the building on all sides, in sufficient detail to clearly discern the precise existing and finish grades.  When a site plan review with the Planning Board is involved, the HDC may request to see any other drawings in the plan set where it determines that examination of such drawings may enhance the HDC’s review. 
1. Elevation Drawings.  Elevation drawings to scale of each affected facade of the building, structure or sign, clearly depicting existing conditions and proposed work. Building heights shall be given as specified in the Zoning Ordinance (See definition for “Building Height”) and in accordance with a topographic plan if one is submitted, above.   In  addition,  the  heights  for  the  highest  points  of  the  building  shall  be provided.  On larger or more complex projects, the HDC may require that a fixed benchmark, near but not on the site, be provided.  When a new building is proposed or when any roof or the height of an existing building is proposed to be raised, the following shall be provided:  elevation drawings of pertinent facades, including building heights, of all buildings on adjacent lots that are within 20 feet of the subject lot. 
4. Details.  Detail drawings of project-specific elements. 
4. Photographs.  Photographs of each side of any building proposed for alterations, additions or demolition, and one of the overall site. 
4. Samples.  Samples, swatches, colors, and/or manufacturer’s cut sheet of materials to be used as appropriate. 
4. Other Items. Any other items which the Commission may reasonably need to conduct its review, including perspective drawings of the subject buildings; accurate, to-scale renderings of nearby buildings; and any type of rendering, view, or model which shows the proposed construction in context. 

   The Commission may, at its discretion, waive requirements for the submission of any or all of the above items as well as for drawings to be precisely drawn to sale on smaller or less complex projects.  There is no application fee for applications to the Historic District Commission. 

2. **Other Requirements**. 
1. Measurements.   Measurements  on  all  plans,  including  building  heights,  shall  be provided in a clear manner.  When revised plans are submitted the measurements shall be provided in a manner consistent with prior plans. 
1. Revisions.  When subsequent revised plans are submitted the revised plans shall clearly indicate every change from the prior set of plans. 
1. Elements subject to review.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to point out or highlight, in some clear manner, every element of the proposed project that is subject to HDC review.  

Changes made by other boards.  When any change in the design approved by the HDC, pertinent to any element subject to HDC review, is made by another body, such as the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment, the plans shall be brought back to the HDC for review and approval. 

2. ***Review of the Application.*** 
1. Determination of Appropriateness.  In deliberating whether to grant or deny a Certificate of Approval, the HDC shall make a determination as to the appropriateness** of the work proposed by determining whether or not the proposal conforms to the provisions of this article and applicable statutes. 
2. Scheduling and Completeness. The HDC will consider applications at its scheduled meetings. At that time a determination shall be made whether the application under consideration is complete in accordance with the list of required items, above, and whether or not further information is needed by the Commission in order to accept the application.  When a project is approved a determination of completeness is understood to be part of the approval.*** 
2. Dialogue  with  Applicant.   The  applicant  may  present  his  or  her  application  at  the Commission meeting(s).  When there are aspects of the proposal which may not conform to  this  article,  the  Commission,  at  its  discretion,  may  advise  the  applicant  to  find reasonable cost approaches to meet his or her objectives with a project which still conforms to the standards of this article. 
2. Public  Hearing.   At  its  discretion,  when  deemed  appropriate,  the***  Commission  is authorized to hold a public hearing at which time opinions of abutters and interested citizens shall be heard.  Notice of the Public Hearing shall be sent to abutters and posted in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing.  In  the  case  of  significant  projects  that  involve  demolition,  the  HDC  may  hold  an additional public hearing any time after the start of construction to allow for concerns to be identified and conveyed to the applicant and Town enforcement officials.  Applicants shall be invited, but are not required to attend any such public hearing.*** 
2. Professional  Advice.  The  Commission  may  seek  advice  from  such  professional, educational, cultural, or other sources as is deemed necessary.  
2. Recommendations. The Commission may make nonbinding recommendations to the applicant on elements outside of its purview such as planting materials. 
2. Setting parameters.  When the Commission deems appropriate in dealing with violations of this ordinance and other matters, it may work with property owners in a flexible manner in setting timeframes and other benchmarks to guide how and when specific work must be completed.
3. ***Action on an Application.*** 
1. To the extent practical and appropriate, as determined by Town staff, an applicant may file applications for permits simultaneously to the Planning Board and the Commission.  Reviews shall be coordinated by the Town staff to ensure that all necessary approvals are obtained and are consistent with one another.  It is useful for the applicant to appear at least once before each board/commission prior to the other board/commission issuing a final approval.***   
1. The HDC shall take action on all applications within forty-five (45) days of the date on which the application is submitted.  This time frame may be extended either by consent or request of the applicant for an additional period.  In cases where the HDC needs additional time to review an application, if the applicant is not willing to grant an extension the HDC may deny the application.*** 
3. The Commission shall file a Certificate of Approval or a Certificate of Denial with the** Planning Department.  Failure by the Commission to act within the period of time specified above shall be deemed to constitute approval of the application as submitted.  A Certificate of Approval, or approval by default of the Commission to take action, shall be effective for one year after the date of approval. If the applicant has neither obtained a building permit (or an extension for one) nor substantially commenced work within this timeframe then the approval shall automatically be deemed null and void.*** 
3. When an application is denied, the reason(s) for the decision shall be conveyed to the applicant and clearly stated in the minutes of the Commission.*** 
3. Oversight of construction.  At its discretion, on larger or more sensitive projects, the Commission may recommend that an architect oversee construction of the elements and details of the building that are part of the HDC’s approval to ensure that the  building is constructed correctly in accordance with the approval.  The HDC may request that progress reports be submitted to the Town and it may identify the requested parameters for those progress reports.   
3. Once a certificate of approval has been issued, any proposed changes to that approval shall be brought back to the HDC for review and approval.  However, if a proposed change is very minor, then the Planning Department may approve the proposed change, in consultation with the HDC chair, provided: 
1. The change is deemed to be insignificant; 
1. The change would be barely noticeable, if at all, from any public street; and 
1. The change would be consistent with the intent of the earlier approval. 
4. ***Appeals***.  Any applicant, persons, or organizations aggrieved by a decision of the HDC** may appeal the decision to the Durham Zoning Board of Adjustment in accordance with RSA 674:33 and any appeal procedures specified in the Town Ordinances. 
4. ***Enforcement***.  The provisions of this article shall be enforced as provided for in Article III, Administration and Enforcement.  No building permit shall be issued for any project until the Building  Inspector  determines  that  the  proposed  plan  is  in  conformance  with  the  design approved by the HDC.  No certificate of occupancy (except for a temporary certificate of occupancy, as appropriate) shall be issued until the Building Inspector determines that the project has been built in accordance with the plans approved by the HDC.  The Building Inspector shall determine in the course of regular inspections that all work is in compliance with the plans approved by the HDC.  When appropriate, the Building Inspector may issue a stop work order at his or her reasonable discretion. 
4. ***Preliminary Review/Discussion***.  A property owner or a designated representative may request a  preliminary  review/discussion  with  the  HDC.   Applicants  who  submit  a  preliminary application  should  include  such  information  and  documentation  as  needed  to  provide  a sufficient background for the proposal and to facilitate the discussion. All comments by HDC members are preliminary, nonbinding, and subject to change.  The submission deadline for preliminary applications is the same as that for regular applications. 

**175-96.   Standards for Review.** 

The following standards shall be used by the HDC in reviewing applications for Certificates of Approval.  

1. ***General Principles*** 
1. Every reasonable effort shall be made to minimize alteration of the significant features of the property. 
1. The distinguishing original qualities or character of the property shall not be destroyed.  The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided where possible. 
1. All structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time.  Alterations that have no historical basis or that are made*** to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
1. Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of the property.  These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
1. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be treated with sensitivity. 
1. Deteriorated  architectural  features  shall  be  repaired  rather  than  replaced,  wherever possible.  In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities.  Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,  substantiated  by  historic,  physical,  or  pictorial  evidence,  rather  than  on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other structures. 
1. Every reasonable effort should be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project. 
1. Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties should not be discouraged when such designs do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and when those designs are compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, and surrounding environment. 
9. Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures should be done in such a manner that if those additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
2. ***Elements of Design*.**  Proposals should be harmonious with existing structures within the District.  The Commission shall consider the following elements of design when evaluating an application: 
1. Scale.  The scale of a building is its size relative to common reference points: e.g. the human body and nearby structures.  New construction should be consistent with the dominant cornice and peak or ridge height of other nearby structures within the HOD.  Inordinately low buildings create a void at upper floor levels that interrupts the feeling of  enclosure.  Disproportionately  tall  buildings  overpower  other  structures.   Most buildings in the district are relatively large with 2-1/2 stories.  Notable exceptions are the 1-1/2 story Samuel Yeaton House and the Red School House. 
1. Elevation  of  the  first  floor  and  floor-to-floor  heights.   Many  of  Durham’s  historic buildings have a slightly raised foundation and floor-to-floor heights which are either greater than or smaller than prevalent heights used in contemporary construction. 
1. Proportions.  Proportion deals with height, width, depth, and spacing   relationships and is important both in the overall dimensions of the building and in its individual components. For example, most windows in the District are rectangular and vertical.  Thus, square, polygonal, or horizontal windows would be inappropriate in many cases. 
1. Massing.  Massing refers to the shapes, sizes, articulation, composition, and voids created by the three dimensional forms that constitute the structure. While many buildings in the District are boxlike and massive with expansive wall areas and small windows, most have subtle  detailing,  graceful  proportions,  multiple  appended  additions,  and  numerous windows, all of which create appeal. Massing tends toward aggregations of simple geometric  shapes  in  keeping  with  traditional  New  Hampshire  rural  and  village architecture rather than the complex forms typical of the late 19th century Queen Anne style. 
1. Roof shape.  Most of the contributing residential buildings have a gable roof and there are several buildings with a hipped roof. Gambrel, mansard, and flat roofs are not found in the district and are therefore inappropriate. 
1. Entrance.  Many of the historic buildings in the District have a porch, a portico, or at least an articulated door surround at the entry.  Entrances are generally situated in the center bay of the facade. 
1. Fenestration.  Fenestration refers to the pattern of window openings - spacing, size, proportion, symmetry vs. asymmetry.  Most buildings in the District have five bays; many have a syncopated rhythm with windows in the outer bays closer to each other than to the window in the center bay. 
8. Materials.   Most buildings in the District are wood frame with wood clapboard siding. There is only one stone house in the District - the James Paul House.  Vinyl and aluminum siding or other artificial materials should not be used although they may be acceptable on elevations that are not visible from a public way.  However, certain artificial materials and other contemporary materials may be acceptable where the HDC has determined that these materials effectively capture the salient aspects of natural materials in terms of appearance, feel, texture, reflectivity, durability and performance, and overall character.  See the Historic District Regulations for acceptable alternate materials.  Where they are used, the reveal should be approximately four inches in width and detailing should be preserved or used to give articulation to the structure. Diagonal and vertical siding is not appropriate. The use of natural materials is encouraged. 
8. Orientation.  While most buildings have their narrower gable end perpendicular to the street in the Georgian manner, many are also oriented with the gable facing the street in the Greek Revival or Italianate manner.  Most buildings within the District are oriented parallel or perpendicular to the street.  Buildings should not be oriented at odd angles to the street, such as at a 45-degree angle, unless this is already the prevailing pattern in the area or if it is dictated by strong topographic or site considerations. 
8. Style and Details.  Most of the buildings in the District were built from the mid-1700s to the mid 1800s in the Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styles. They are predominantly  simple,  conservative,  and  restrained  in  design.   Common  or  distinct features include brick chimneys, dormers, attic gable windows, eave brackets, painted shutters, corner pilasters, ells, porches, three-sided window bays, sidelights, and transom windows, stone walls, and white picket fences. 
3. ***New Construction*.** New construction is an essential process in a vital community, representing the current phase of an evolution that has been ongoing since the settlement of Durham.  Contemporary architecture may be appropriate, provided that it is respectful of the historic fabric of the District. New construction within the Historic District should be consistent with Sections A and B, above. 
3. ***Demolition or Removal*.** No existing building or other structure may be***~~ demolished or moved out of the Historic Overlay District until approval has been granted by the HDC. Demolition or removal from the District of a contributing structure is strongly discouraged and shall rarely be permitted. An application which includes a detailed plan for the reuse of the site shall be submitted, and the Commission shall determine the appropriateness of the plan. It shall only be approved if the applicant demonstrates that 1) denial of the application would result in extreme hardship unique to the subject property or the plan for redevelopment of the site is considered to be beneficial overall for the Historic District; and 2) the Commission has approved a detailed redevelopment plan for the site. Financial hardship of the owner of the property shall not constitute a hardship for this purpose.  
5. ***Relocation within the District***.  Relocation of a contributing structure on its site or within the District is discouraged.  The Commission may approve such a relocation only if it determines that there are compelling reasons to do so after conducting a thorough review of the request. 
5. ***Other Issues***  
1. Noncontributing  Structures.  The  procedures  set  forth  in  175-95  will  be  followed. However, the HDC may, at its discretion, engage in a less stringent review of such noncontributing structures. In some** cases, demolition or relocation of a noncontributing structure may be** entirely appropriate, depending upon how the site will be developed afterward. 
1. Parking.  Parking areas, particularly when paved and unbroken by landscaping, can have a significantly deleterious impact upon historic areas. All parking areas for other than single-family uses shall be located at the rear of buildings.  Where the Commission determines that such placement is not practicable, parking may be located at the side of buildings provided that no part of the parking  area is  located forward  of the front elevation of the building.  Any parking area located on the side of a building shall be screened from the road. 
1. Fences. Chain link fences shall not be used in front yards or in side yards if they would be visible from a public way.*** 
1. Screening.  All utility elements such as dumpsters, garbage cans, propane tanks, above- ground oil tanks, and ground-mounted air  conditioning units shall be screened and located such that they are not visible from a public way. 
1. The U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s “Guidelines for Historic Preservation” shall also serve as a guide for the Commission. 
7. ***Signage – Design Standards***. The following design standards shall apply to all signs that are subject to review by the Historic District Commission (per Subsection 175-94 Purview of Board) 

   The Historic District Commission and the Town of Durham do not have purview over verbal content, which is protected by the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution.   

The following aspects of a sign are subject to review by the HDC: 1.Overall design 

2\.Types of signs and locations 

3\.Number of signs 

4\.Size and shape 

5\.Materials 

6\.Colors

**ARTICLE XVIII** 

**PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES OVERLAY DISTRICT** 

**175-99.  Purpose and Intent.** 

It is the express purpose of this Article to permit carriers to locate personal wireless service facilities within particular areas of the Town of Durham consistent with appropriate land use regulations that will ensure compatibility with the visual and environmental features of the Town.  Compatibility with the visual features of Durham is measured based on the change in community scale and character in relation to the height, mass, materials, contrasts, or proportion within the surroundings of a proposed personal wireless service facility.  This Article enables the review of the locating and siting of personal wireless service facilities by the Town of Durham so as to eliminate or mitigate the visual and environmental impacts of personal wireless service facilities.  This Article is structured to encourage carriers to locate on existing buildings and structures whenever possible.  New ground mounted personal wireless facilities are permitted, but only when the use of existing structures and buildings are found to be infeasible.  Co-location is encouraged for all personal wireless service facility applications and the review of a personal wireless facility shall be on the basis of the site being built using all positions on the mount.  The Town of Durham encourages the location of personal wireless service facilities (PWSF) in non-residential areas. 

**175-100.  Applicability.** 

The terms of this Article and the Site Plan Review Regulations shall apply to personal wireless service facilities proposed to be located on property owned by the Town of Durham, on privately owned property, and on property that is owned by any other governmental entity that acts in its proprietary capacity to lease such property to a carrier. 

**175-101.  District Regulations.** 

1. ***Location***.  Personal wireless service facilities shall be permitted in all Zoning Districts, except as restricted by this Article.  Applicants seeking approval for personal wireless service facilities shall first evaluate existing structures for the siting of personal wireless service facilities.  Only after finding that there are no suitable existing structures pursuant to Section*** 175-101. C. herein, shall a provider propose a new ground mounted facility.  Applicants for new PWSF shall place antennas and towers at locations which will minimize the impact on residential neighborhoods.  In no case shall a PWSF be allowed in designated conservation areas unless they are located on existing tower facilities. 
1. ***Existing Structures – Policy***.  Personal wireless service facilities shall be located on existing structures, including but not limited to buildings, water towers, existing telecommunications facilities, utility poles or towers, and related facilities, provided that such installation preserves the character and integrity of those structures. 
3. ***Existing Structures – Burden of Proof***.  The applicant shall have the burden of proving that there are no existing structures which are suitable to locate its personal wireless service facility and/or transmit or receive radio signals.  To meet that burden, the applicant shall take all the following actions to the extent applicable: 
1. The applicant shall submit to the Department of Planning and Community Development a list of all contacts made with owners of potential sites regarding the availability of potential space for a personal wireless service facility.  If the Planning Board or Department of Planning  and Community  Development  informs the  applicant  that  additional  existing structures may be satisfactory, the applicant shall contact the property owner(s) of those structures. 
1. The applicant shall provide copies of all letters of inquiry made to owners of existing structures and letters of rejection.  If letters of rejection are not provided, at a minimum, unanswered “Return Receipt Requested” forms from the U.S. Post office shall be provided for each owner of existing structures that was contacted. 
1. If the applicant claims that a structure is not capable of physically supporting a personal wireless  service  facility,  this  claim  must  be  certified by  a  licensed professional  civil engineer.   The  certification  shall,  at  a  minimum,  explain  the  structural  issues  and demonstrate that the structure cannot be modified to support the personal wireless service facility without unreasonable costs.  The estimated cost shall be provided to the Planning Board. 
4. ***Ground Mounted Facilities – Policy***.  If the applicant demonstrates that it is not feasible to locate on an existing structure, ground mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be designed so as to be camouflaged to the greatest extent possible, including but not limited to: use of alternative tower structures, use of compatible building materials and colors, screening, landscaping, and placement within trees.  If the applicant does not propose the use of alternative tower structures, then the applicant shall provide evidence as to why it is unsuitable.  Costs of alternative tower structures that exceed regular tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the alternate tower structure unsuitable. 
4. ***Locations  for  Ground  Mounted  Facilities***.   Ground  mounted  personal  wireless  service facilities shall be prohibited from those areas identified on the “Town of Durham, NH Visual Sensitivity Project - Composite Overlay,” dated March 13, 1998, and prepared by Strafford Regional Planning Commission using data from the original map created by Complex Systems Research Center, Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space, University of New Hampshire.  The “Town of Durham, NH Visual Sensitivity Project - Composite Overlay” is hereby  adopted  as  an  overlay to the official  Zoning  Map  of the Town of  Durham  and incorporated in this Article by reference.  If the site is within or adjacent to a residential zone, then a study shall be provided showing which alternative sites that are not within or adjacent to a residential zone were considered and why these locations are not acceptable. 
6. ***All  PWSF  –  Policy***.   All  applicants  for  PWSF  shall  submit  information  related  to  the availability of alternative technologies.  If no alternative technologies exist to accommodate the applicant’s proposed PWSF, then the applicant shall submit evidence to demonstrate that no alternative technologies can accommodate the applicants proposed PWSF and said evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following:  that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network using multiple low- powered  transmitters/receivers  attached  to  a  wire  line  system,  is  unsuitable.   Costs  of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 

**175-102.  Use Regulations.** 

A personal wireless service facility shall require a building permit in all cases and may be permitted as follows: 

1. ***Existing Tower Structures***.  Subject to the issuance of a building permit that includes review by the Director of Planning and Community Development, carriers may locate a personal wireless service facility on any guyed tower, lattice tower, mast, or monopole in existence prior to the adoption of this Article, or on any personal wireless service facility previously approved under the provisions of this Article so long as the co-location complies with the approved site plan.  All the Performance Standards from this Article shall be met.  This provision shall apply only so long as the height of the mount is not increased, a security barrier already exists, and the area of the security barrier is not increased.  Otherwise, site plan review is required. 
1. ***Reconstruction  of  Existing  Tower  Structures***.   An  existing  guyed  tower,  lattice  tower, monopole, or mast in existence prior to the adoption of this Article may be reconstructed with a maximum twenty (20) foot increase in height so as to maximize co-location so long as the standards of this Article are met and so long as this twenty (20) foot increase in height does not cause a facility previously existing at less than two hundred (200) feet to exceed two hundred (200) feet in height.  The mount shall be replaced with a similar mount that does not significantly increase the visual impact on the community.  Site plan review is required. 
1. ***Existing Structures***.  Subject to the provisions of this Article and site plan review and except as otherwise permitted under Section 175-101.A, a carrier may locate a personal wireless service facility on an existing structure, building, utility tower or pole, or water tower.  If siting on a utility pole, the protrusions from the face of the pole should be no greater than one-half the diameter of the pole itself and in no cases greater than 12 inches.  If antennas are included in a radome shield on top of the pole, the shield shall have a maximum overhang of 4 inches.  In no instance shall the pole be wider than the minimum necessary to support the proposed equipment.  Both Cellular and PCS can use dual-polarized antennas. 
1. ***Ground Mounted Facility***. A personal wireless service facility involving construction of a ground mount shall require site plan review and be subject to the provisions of this Article. 

**175-103.  Dimensional Requirements.** 

1. Personal wireless service facilities shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Height, Maximum.  In no case shall a personal wireless service facility exceed two hundred (200) feet in height, unless the mount for the facility was greater than two hundred (200) feet in height prior to the adoption of this Article.  The applicant shall demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the site’s function. 
1. Height, Existing Structures and Utility Poles.  Carriers that locate new personal wireless service facilities on water towers, electric transmission and distribution towers, utility poles and similar existing utility structures, guyed towers, lattice towers, masts, and monopoles may be permitted to increase the height of those structures no more than twenty (20) feet.  This increase in height shall only be permitted once for each structure. 
1. Height, Other Existing Structures.  The height of a personal wireless service facility shall not increase the height of a structure by more than ten (10) feet, unless the facility is completely camouflaged; for example a facility completely within a flagpole, steeple, or chimney.  The increase in the height of the structure shall be in scale and proportion to the structure as originally configured.  A carrier may locate a personal wireless service facility on a building that is legally non-conforming with respect to height, provided that the provisions of this Article are met. 
1. Height, Ground-Mounted Facilities.  Ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall not project higher than (10) ten feet above the average tree canopy height within a one hundred and fifty (150) foot perimeter of the mount, security barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment, whichever is greatest. 
1. Setbacks.  All personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall comply with the building setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located.  Fences shall comply with the setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located if the fence is six (6) feet or more in height. 
1. Fall Zone for Ground Mounts.  In order to ensure public safety, the minimum distance from the base of any ground-mount of a personal wireless service facility to any property line, public road, habitable dwelling, business or institutional use, or public recreational area shall be, at a minimum, the distance equal to the fall zone, as defined in this Article.  The fall zone may cross property lines, so long as the applicant secures a fall zone easement from the affected property owner(s).  The area of the easement shall be shown on all applicable plans submitted to the Town, and the terms of the easement shall be provided as part of the site plan review. 
1. Fall Zone for Non-Ground Mounts.  In the event that an existing structure is proposed as a mount for a personal wireless service facility, a fall zone shall not be required, but the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the case of pre-existing non- conforming structures, personal wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall not increase any non-conformity. 
2. ***Planning Board Flexibility***.  Heights - In reviewing a site plan application for a personal wireless service facility, the Planning Board may permit an increase in the height of a ground mounted facility up to twenty (20) feet above the average tree canopy height, if no material increase in visual or environmental impacts will result from the increased height.  The visual and environmental criteria of this Article and the Site Plan Review Regulations shall be the guidelines in making this determination. 

**175-104.  Performance and Design Standards.** 

1. ***Visibility*** 
1. Visual impacts are measured on the basis of: 
1. Change in community scale, as exhibited in relative height, mass or proportion of the personal wireless service facility within their proposed surroundings. 
1. New visible elements proposed on a contrasting background. 
1. Different colors and textures proposed against a contrasting background. 

e.  Use of materials that are foreign to the existing built environment. 

2. Enhancements are measured on the basis of: 
1. Conservation of opportunities to maintain community scale, e.g., buffering areas and low-lying buildings should not be compromised so as to start a trend away from the existing community scale. 
1. Amount and type of landscaping and/or natural vegetation. 
1. Preservation of view corridors, vistas, and viewsheds. 
1. Continuation of existing colors, textures, and materials. 
3. Visibility focuses on: 
   1. Eliminating or mitigating visual impact. 
   1. Protecting, continuing, and enhancing the existing environment. 
3. Concealment or Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures - Roof Mounts:  When a personal wireless service facility extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort shall be made to conceal or camouflage the facility within or behind existing or new architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front facade in order to limit their impact on the building’s silhouette. 
3. Concealment or Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures  - Side Mounts:  Personal wireless service facilities which are side mounted shall blend with the existing building's architecture and, if individual antenna panels are over five (5) square feet, the panels shall be painted, shielded, or concealed with material consistent with the design features and materials of the building. 
3. Camouflage for Ground Mounted Facilities:  All ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth that extends continuously for 

   a minimum distance of one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the mount, security barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment, whichever is greatest, and screens views of the facility in all directions, as set forth in Figure XVIII – 1.  These trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or be within a landscape easement on an adjoining site.  The Planning Board shall have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on site conditions.  The one hundred and fifty (150) foot vegetative buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within the area of the carrier’s lease.  The easement or lease shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall not be removed or topped, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons or property. 

7. Disguise for Facilities on Existing Buildings and Structures (Roof and Side Mounts) and Ground Mounted Facilities:  Applicants may choose to change the appearance of the facility to make it appear to be something other than a PWSF.

**PART C.   STANDARDS** 

**ARTICLE XIX                  CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS** 

**175-107.  Conservation Subdivisions.** 

This  section  was  adopted  pursuant  to  the  Town  of  Durham’s  2000  Master  Plan  which recommended that conservation subdivisions, in which a substantial portion of the site is set aside as  permanent,  common  open  space,  be  the  primary  form  of  residential  development  in  the community.  The provisions of this section govern the design and development of conservation subdivisions.  The process for the design of conservation subdivisions, as set forth in the Town’s Subdivision Regulations, requires that key natural, historic, archeological, and cultural features on the site be identified for protection and the development planned to protect these resources.** 

1. ***Purpose*.**  The purposes of these provisions are to assure that conservation subdivisions developed in the Town of Durham: 
1. Preserve those areas of the site that have the highest value for conservation purposes; 
1. Preserve  identified  historic,  known  archeological  and  identified  cultural  features located on the site: 
1. Locate  the  buildings  and  structures  on  those  portions  of  the  site  that  are  most appropriate for development considering both the development suitability of the site and its conservation value; 
1. Create continuous open spaces or “greenways” by linking the common open spaces in adjoining subdivisions wherever possible; and 
1. Minimize the impact of residential development on the Town, neighboring properties, and the natural environment.** 
2. ***Applicability.***   All  residential  subdivisions  in  the  Residence  A  District,  Residence  B District, Residence Coastal District, Rural District, Office Research Light Industry District, and  Mixed  Use  and  Office  Research  District  shall  be  developed  as  Conservation Subdivisions in accordance with the provisions of this section and the Town’s Subdivision Regulations unless the subdivision is exempt from this requirement based upon subsection 
   3. below. 
2. ***Exempt Subdivisions.***  A proposed subdivision is exempt from being developed as a Conservation Subdivision only if the proposed subdivision meets one of the following criteria.  In determining if the criteria are met, any lot that has been or will be transferred to a qualified conservation organization (as defined in Article II) and will be restricted to conservation use in perpetuity, shall not be counted as a lot for the purpose of this provision. 
1. Three-lot subdivision. The subdivision will consist of a total of three (3) or fewer lots accommodating  a  total  of  not  more  than  three  (3)  dwelling  units  (not  including accessory dwelling units) and there will be no potential for the future subdivision of the parcel or any of the lots created by the subdivision (other than for a boundary line adjustment) nor for the construction of additional dwelling units on any of the lots, or 
1. 400,000 square foot lots. The subdivision will consist of lots, all of which will have a minimum lot area of four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet , and there will be no potential for the future subdivision of the parcel or any of the lots created by the subdivision nor for the construction of additional dwelling units on any of the lots, or 
1. Three lots with future plan. The subdivision will consist of three (3) or fewer lots accommodating a total of not more than three (3) dwelling units, there is additional land  that  may  be  developable  in  the  future  for  which  a  Conceptual  Long  Range Development Plan meeting the requirements of subsection N. will be prepared, all lots being created as part of the exempt subdivision will be consistent with and incorporated into the long range plan as part of a conservation subdivision, and no additional lots will be created in the future that are not part of a conservation subdivision, or 
1. One lot each 7 years. The subdivision will create not more than one additional lot accommodating one (1) dwelling unit and no other lots have been created from the parcel within the preceding seven (7) year period.  This exemption allows for the subdivision of one lot at a time, leaving residual land for potential future subdivisions, provided that at least 7 years pass between subdivisions. 
4. ***Maximum Development Density*.**  The maximum number of dwelling units that may be developed in a Conservation Subdivision shall be determined by dividing the calculated Usable Area of the parcel by the required Minimum Usable Area Per Dwelling Unit for the district in which the subdivision is located (see Section*** 175-54,** Table of Dimensions) and rounding down to the maximum allowed whole number of units.  If the parcel is located in more than one district, the maximum number of units allowed on the portion of the parcel in each district shall be calculated separately and the allowed maximum number of units (including fractional units) in each district shall be added together and then rounded down to the allowed number of whole units.  If the subdivision involves only part of a parcel, the Usable Area shall be calculated for that portion of the parcel proposed to be included in the subdivision and the determination of the maximum number of dwelling units within the subdivision  determined  based  upon  that  Usable  Area.  The  Planning  Board  shall  not approve a plan for a Conservation Subdivision that provides for the development of more dwelling units than the maximum number determined by this section. 
4. ***Lots in a Conservation Subdivision*.**  Residences** in a Conservation Subdivision may be located on individual residential lots, or on common lots with more than one dwelling unit on a lot, or a combination thereof.  If more than one dwelling unit will be located on a lot, the ownership and management arrangements for that lot, and the units thereon, shall be detailed as part of the subdivision application and those arrangements shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations. 
6. ***Individual Lot Sizes*.**  If individual lots are created as part of a Conservation Subdivision, the lots shall conform to the following minimum lot size requirements: 
1. Any lot that has its required lot frontage on a public street that existed as of July 1, 2003 shall conform to the minimum lot size requirement for the district in which it is located (see Section*** 175-54, Table of Dimensions). 
1. Any lot that has its required lot frontage on a public street created after July 1, 2003, including streets to be developed as part of the subdivision or private ways, may be smaller than the required minimum lot size for the district in which it is located.  The size of the individual lots shall be shown on the subdivision plan and shall be subject to Planning Board approval based upon its finding that the lot sizes will allow for the creation of a high quality living environment for the residents of the subdivision and provide for adequate sewage disposal, but in no case shall any lot served by a private wastewater disposal system be less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet in area. 
7. ***Individual  Lot  Frontages*.**   If  individual  lots  are  created  as  part  of  a  Conservation Subdivision, the lots shall conform to the following minimum lot frontage requirements: 
1. Any lot that has its required lot frontage on a public street that existed as of July 1, 2003 shall conform to the minimum lot frontage requirement for the district in which it is located (see Section*** 175-54, Table of Dimensions).

In no case, shall two adjacent driveways be located on a public street that existed as of July 1, 2003 unless the driveways are separated by at least one hundred (100)  feet  or  such  other  greater  distance  as  required  by  other  provisions  of  this ordinance. 
1. Any lot that has its required lot frontage on a public street created after July 1, 2003, including streets to be developed as part of the subdivision or private ways, may have less frontage than the required minimum lot frontage for the district in which it is located.   The  amount  of  frontage  for  the  individual  lots  shall  be  shown  on  the subdivision plan and shall be subject to Planning Board approval based upon its finding that the lot frontages will allow for the creation of a high quality living environment for the residents of the subdivision and provide adequate access to the residences and other facilities, but in no case shall any lot have less than fifty (50) feet of lot frontage. 
8. ***Common Open Space*.**  A Conservation Subdivision shall provide for the permanent set aside and protection of common open space meeting the following requirements: 
1. The amount of common open space provided within the subdivision shall be equal to or greater the sum of the following: 
1. the percentage of the calculated Usable Area set forth below, plus 
1. the unsuitable area of the parcel that is deducted from the gross area of the site to determine the Usable Area.  

The minimum percentage of the usable area that shall be set aside for common open space shall be as follows:

9. ***Front Yard Setbacks*.** 
1. The minimum front yard setback for any lot with its required lot frontage on a public street in existence as of July 1, 2003 shall be the required minimum setback for the type of street and the district in which the subdivision is located (see Section 175-54,** Table of Dimensions) or thirty (30) feet whichever is greater. 
1. The minimum front yard setback for any lot with its required lot frontage on a public street created after July 1, 2003, including streets to be developed as part of the subdivision or private ways, may be less than that required by the district regulations.  The size of the minimum setback shall be shown on the subdivision plan, may vary from lot to lot or in different areas of the subdivision, and shall be subject to Planning Board approval based upon its finding that the setbacks will allow for the creation of a high quality living environment for the residents of the subdivision and provide for adequate privacy and public safety. 
1. If  the  approved  front  yard  setback  for  any  lot  is  less  than  that  required  by  the requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located (see Section*** 175-54,** Table of Dimensions), any garage with garage doors that face the street, whether attached or detached, shall be located so that the front wall of the garage is located at least two (2) feet behind the front wall of the principal building.  This requirement shall not apply to a garage located in the basement of a single-family home. 
4. If  the  approved  front  yard  setback  for  any  lot  is  less  than  that  required  by  the requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located (see Section*** 175-54,** Table of Dimensions), any accessory building shall be located so that  

   the front wall of the accessory building is located at least two (2) feet behind the front wall of the principal building.  

10. ***Side and Rear Yard Setbacks*.** 
1. When a side or rear yard of a lot containing a residence or other building abuts the external perimeter or property line of a Conservation Subdivision, the minimum side and rear yard setbacks shall be the required minimum setback for the district in which the  subdivision  is  located  (see  Section***  175-54,**  Table  of  Dimensions)  unless  the streetscape buffer requirements of L. result in a greater setback . 
1. The  minimum  side  and  rear  yard  setbacks  from  internal  property  lines  within  a Conservation Subdivision may be less than the required setbacks established by the district  regulations  (see  Section***  175-54**,**  Table  of  Dimensions).   The  size  of  the minimum setbacks shall be shown on the subdivision plan, may vary from lot to lot or in different areas of the subdivision, and shall be subject to Planning Board approval based upon its finding that the setbacks will allow for the creation of a high quality living environment for the residents of the subdivision and provide for adequate privacy and public safety. 
1. In all cases, the separation distance between principal buildings within the subdivision, whether on the same lot or on different lots, shall conform to the requirements of the Town’s building code and the NFPA fire protection codes based upon the type of construction and the use of the buildings. 
11. ***Streetscape Buffer Adjacent to Existing Public Streets*.**  A vegetated buffer strip shall be maintained  along  any  public  street  existing  as  of  July  1,  2003  that  is  adjacent  to  a Conservation Subdivision to minimize the visual impact of the Conservation Subdivision on the streetscape.  The depth of the buffer strip shall be at least three times the minimum front yard setback requirement for the zoning district in which the parcel is located and the type of street (see Table of Dimensions) or one hundred (100) feet whichever is greater.  This provision shall be reduced to twenty-five (25) feet for individual residential lots that front on public streets that existed as of July 1, 2003.  No parking, buildings, structures, or recreational facilities shall be permitted within this buffer strip but accessory structures such as signs, walls, underground utility structures, and drainage facilities may be located within this buffer.  The buffer strip may be crossed by driveways or access drives that run essentially perpendicular to the street.  The buffer strip shall be naturally vegetated or landscaped  in  accordance  with  the  landscaping  provisions  of  Article  XXII  and  the 

    treatment shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board as part of the approval of the subdivision.  Appropriate legal mechanisms shall be established by the subdivider, subject to approval by the Planning Board as part of the approval of the subdivision, to assure that the buffer strip will be permanently protected and maintained. 

12. ***Perimeter  Buffer*.**   A  vegetated  buffer  strip  shall  be  maintained  along  the  external perimeter or property line of the Conservation Subdivision to minimize the impact of the Conservation Subdivision on abutting properties.  The width of the buffer strip shall be at least the minimum setback requirement for the zone in which the subdivision is located.  If the subdivision abuts a water body or wetland, the width and treatment of the buffer shall be consistent with the requirements of the Wetland Conservation Overlay District and/or the Shoreland Protection Overlay District.  No parking, buildings, structures, access roads or  driveways,  or  recreational  facilities  shall  be  permitted  within  this  buffer  strip  but accessory structures such as*** walls, underground utility structures, and drainage facilities may  be  located  within  this  buffer.   The  buffer  strip  shall  be  naturally  vegetated  or landscaped  in  accordance  with  the  landscaping  provisions  of  Article  XXII  and  the treatment shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board as part of the approval of the subdivision.  Appropriate legal mechanisms shall be established by the subdivider, subject to approval by the Planning Board, to assure that the buffer strip will be permanently protected and maintained. 
13. ***Conceptual Long Range Development Plan*.**  When a Conservation Subdivision will not utilize the entire parcel and there is potential for future subdivision or development of the parcel or any of the lots being created, the application for subdivision approval shall include a Conceptual Long Range Development Plan showing the potential utilization of the lots and the balance of the parcel not being subdivided.  The Long Range Plan is intended to be conceptual in nature, to rely on published data about natural resources relevant to the parcel and the built environment, and to demonstrate that the current subdivision proposal will not compromise important conservation values or the long-term development of the parcel as a Conservation Subdivision.  This plan shall show the relationship of the proposed subdivision area to the balance of the parcel and to adjacent land. This plan shall analyze the conservation and development potential of the remaining area of the parcel and shall show, in general terms, the potential street network, open space areas, and development areas in a manner that demonstrates that both the proposed development and the future development  can  occur  so  that  it  conforms  to  the  requirements  for  Conservation Subdivisions and preserves the significant natural resource and conservation values of the entire parcel.

**ARTICLEXX.1                          STANDARDSFORAGRICULTURALUSES** 

**175-109.1. Purpose.** 

The purpose of this article and of other provisions in this chapter related to agriculture is to: 

1. Help preserve a working landscape of farms, gardens, and forests; 
1. Support local farms, farmers, and food production; 
1. Foster long-term economic and environmental sustainability and resilience;  and 
1. Fulfill the goals included in the Agricultural Resources Master Plan and those pertinent to agriculture established by the Durham Town Council  

**175-109.2.  Compliance Required.** 

This article establishes performance standards for agricultural uses.  These standards must be met for all activities involving the specified uses. 

1. General Provisions.   The following provisions apply to all agricultural uses and activities: 
1. See definitions of various agricultural activities under AGRICULTURE in Article II.  See 

Agricultural Uses in the Table of Uses.  There is no set limit on the number of principal and accessory  uses  related  to  agriculture  that  may  be  established  on  a  lot  (though  other requirements may effectively serve to limit the number of uses).  

2. Best management practices.  Best management practices shall include technologies recommended from time to time by the university of New Hampshire cooperative extension,  the  New  Hampshire  department  of  agriculture,  markets,  and  food,  or appropriate agencies of the United States Department of Agriculture (per RSA 21:34-

   a).  Best management practices shall be applied to all pertinent aspects of the farm, including but not limited to the following: 

1. Manure, compost from manure, and odor from animals.  Manure must be removed from the structure and immediate area housing animals and composted or disposed of in a timely manner.  
1. Feed.  Feed should be stored in fully enclosed and secured containers in order to prevent pests and predators. 
1. Slaughtering of animals. 
3. Site plan review.   
1. Site plan review is required as specified in the text of Section 175-53 – Table of Land Uses and in the Site Plan Regulations (except as specified in b., below).  Site plan review is required for all buildings, driveways, parking areas, public use areas, and  significant  structures  and  for  site  changes  that  are  part  of  any  commercial agricultural  operation.   Site  plan  review  is  not  required  for  non-commercial agriculture. 
1. Site plan review is not required for uses that are accessory to single-family and duplex residences nor for temporary farmstands.  The establishment, expansion, or change of the uses specified under Agricultural Uses in the Table of Uses is exempt from site plan review (though physical changes to the site ordinarily reviewed, such as  building  construction,  are  subject  to  review),  with  the  exception  of  Farmers’ Markets; Agricultural Sales, Commercial; and Aquaculture which are subject to site plan review. 
3. Applicants for projects related to agriculture may request waivers from specific provisions of the site plan requirements as allowed.  Such projects may also be eligible for review under the Minor Site Plan process.   
4. Minimum  acreage  is  established in  the  Table  of  Uses  for  specific  agricultural uses (Additional standards are given in Table 109.1E).  In cases where minimums are established for more than one use occurring on a property, the minimum acreages are not added together.  For example, if 3 acres is required for each of two uses, then 3 acres will be sufficient to accommodate both uses. 
4. All animals must be contained on the subject lot.  It is the responsibility of the property owner to contain the animals through appropriate means which may or may not include fencing.  
4. Fences used for agricultural purposes, such as the containment of livestock and poultry or the protection of crops, may be located at the property line and need not meet setbacks otherwise applicable to fencing.  The vertical opacity of any such fences that are higher than six feet shall not exceed 25% (for the purpose of maintaining an open view through the fence). 
4. Housing structure.  An appropriate structure for housing animals shall be provided in accordance with University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension Housing and Space Guidelines.  Chickens and turkeys shall be maintained in the structure from sunset to sunrise.

8. Housing  structure setbacks.  Structures  for housing  animals shall  meet  all  setbacks applicable to structures.  The structure shall not be placed in the front court (including for corner lots).  However, in the Rural Zoning District the structure may be placed in the front court provided it is set back at least 50 feet from the front (or side, for*** corner lots) property line.  In the Residence A and Residence B Districts, the structure shall be reasonably screened from the road. All requirements in this subsection may be changed by special exception. 
8. Guidance from Agricultural Commission.  Landowners and others with questions or concerns related to this ordinance and to agriculture in general are encouraged to speak with the Durham Agricultural Commission. Interested parties should contact the Town Planning Department. 
8. Complaints.  When a complaint is issued regarding any agricultural use, at the option of the  Town’s  enforcement  official,  the  complaint  may  be  referred  to  the  Agricultural Commission which may then investigate the complaint and seek to resolve it, as appropriate.  When such a complaint is reviewed by  the Agricultural Commission, regardless of the outcome of the Agricultural Commission’s review, the Town’s enforcement official shall nonetheless maintain responsibility for ultimate disposition of the complaint, in accordance with Town law.  
8. Housing and Land Area Standards.  See Section E below. 
12. Irrigation.  Irrigation is subject to applicable water withdrawal and use restrictions of the State of New Hampshire and the Town of Durham. 
12. Number of Buildings.  There is no set limit on the number of  allowed agricultural buildings, whether principal or accessory buildings, on lots of three acres or greater (This provision overrides several general limitations included elsewhere in this ordinance). 
12. Permits.  A building, fence, and/or sign permit may be required depending on specific circumstances. See the Code Administrator for clarification, where appropriate. 
2. Chickens and Turkeys, Keeping of – Accessory Use.  The following terms and conditions apply to the keeping of chickens and turkeys as an accessory use: 
1. Single/Two Family.  The keeping of chickens and turkeys is permitted as an accessory use to single-family and duplex residences only.

**ARTICLE XXII LANDSCAPING** 

**175-114.  Purpose and Intent.** 

The purpose of this Landscaping Article is to establish procedures and practices governing the protection,  installation  and  long-term  maintenance  of  trees,  vegetation  and  other  landscape elements.  Except where otherwise specifically stated, this article applies only to subdivisions of land where a new street is involved. 

**175-115.  Invasive Species.** 

No person shall collect, transport, import, export, move, buy, sell, distribute, propagate or transplant any living and viable portion of any plant species, including all of their cultivars and varieties,  included  in  Table  3800.1,  New  Hampshire  prohibited  invasive  species  list,  as amended, or included in Env-Wq 1303.02 list of Prohibited Exotic Aquatic Weeds as published by the New Hampshire Division of Environmental Services.  This restriction does not apply to the  removal  or  eradication  of  any  invasive  species  in  accordance  with  best  management practices.  This provision applies to all property in Durham. 

[Reference:[ https://www.agriculture.nh.gov/publications-forms/documents/prohibited-invasive- species.pdf;](https://www.agriculture.nh.gov/publications-forms/documents/prohibited-invasive-species.pdf)[ https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/legal/rules/documents/env- wq1300.pdf\]](https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/legal/rules/documents/env-wq1300.pdf) 

**175-116.   Subdivision Areas.** 

During the development and construction process, wooded natural and non-wooded natural areas will be manipulated to maintain a healthy vegetative cover to maintain the soil structure, minimize soil erosion and enhance the quality of the proposed community. In wooded natural areas, the healthy forest cover will be retained to reduce the amount of stormwater running across the ground surface. 

1. ***Wooded natural areas***. 
1. Plant community groupings or forest types will be identified, and the negative response to construction  for  plant  groupings  or  forest  types shall be  identified  based  on  forestry management principles. 
1. Trees targeted for harvest/removal shall be clearly marked. 
1. Trees to be protected during clearing operations and construction shall be clearly marked to caution operators. 
1. Trees of special interest, historic trees or trees having unusual silvicultural characteristics shall be flagged and located on the landscaping plan. These existing trees shall be protected during construction as outlined in Section 175-117. 
1. The landscape plan will include a reforestation plan to establish trees in appropriate places, not to attempt to design finished landscaping near home sites. The plan is intended to establish and enhance forest cover in certain areas and/or create screens and buffer strips in critical locations, i.e., sewer/water easements. Proposed screening and buffer strips will receive plantings of evergreens three (3) to four (4) feet in minimum height, planting on ten-by-ten-foot centers (i.e., white pine, red pine or hemlock). 
1. A site inspection by the Durham Tree Warden of trees marked for saving, cutting or clear- cutting is required prior to cutting of the lot. 
2. ***Non-wooded natural areas***. For subdivisions in open fields and other non-wooded areas, the landscape plan will include a mix of tree species to be planted on thirty-foot centers to provide for a tree canopy. The trees will be planted within the town right-of-way or on the private property boundary line adjacent to the town right-of-way. 
2. ***Roadway slopes***. In cases where the sloped areas extend more than ten (10) feet from the shoulder to the ditch line, the sloped areas must be landscaped and planted as determined by the Planning Board. 

**175-117.  Protection During Construction.** 

1. Fencing or other protective barrier shall be used around trees near construction sites. 
1. Changes in the normal drainage patterns shall be avoided, and appropriate protection shall be provided for trees if a grade change is necessary in the surrounding area. 
1. Pedestrian and other traffic patterns should be kept away from trees to avoid soil compaction. 
4. Practices for the proper protection of trees on construction sites shall be in accordance with the guidelines in the following references: 
1. Tree  Protection  Manual  for  Builders  and  Developers,  1979,  Florida  Department  of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Tallahassee, Florida. 
1. Protecting  Shade  Trees  During  Home  Construction,  United  States  Department  of Agriculture, Home and Garden Bulletin No. 104, 1977, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. 
1. Environmental  Do's  and  Don’ts  on  Construction  Sites,  United  States  Department  of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Publication No. 1291, 1974. 
5. If the above guidelines are not followed and a tree is damaged or destroyed during construction, the developer shall be required to pay to the Town of Durham the assessed value of said tree, to a maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per tree, the cost to be determined by guidelines in a Guide to Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimens and Evergreens, 1982, International Society of Arboriculture, Urbana, Illinois, or per an updated version. 
5. Protection of existing vegetation during construction shall include, wherever possible, open field or non-treed areas. 

**175-118.  Maintenance Requirements.** 

The maintenance requirements as outlined below shall apply specifically to trees planted as part of subdivisions. 

1. All  newly  planted  vegetative  material  shall  be  guaranteed  to  meet  minimum  American Standard for Nursery Stock standards at the time of planting and for one (1) year thereafter. 
1. Any agreement for long-term maintenance of any landscaping project must be negotiated prior to approval of a subdivision request based on the following criteria: 
1. Vegetation replacement. 
1. Irrigation. 
1. Pruning, fertilizing and insect and disease protection. 
1. Litter or debris cleanup. 
1. Drainage and tree protection if there is a grade change. 
3. A maintenance program shall be established. Pruning should be started early and kept up at regular intervals. Trees should be pruned and shaped to avoid splitting later in life. Broken tops and branches should be removed as soon as possible after injury. Broken, weak or diseased branches should be removed first, dead branches second and healthy branches last. 
3. Trees and shrubs should be protected against damage incurred with lawn mowers and garden equipment. Keeping grass away from tree trunks with the use of mulch is recommended.  
5. The use of road salt around the trees and shrubs should be avoided or minimized. 
5. Required landscaped areas shall be routinely maintained free of debris and litter and in good condition,  with  regular  mowing  of  grass,  so  as  to  present  a  neat,  healthy  and  orderly appearance. Maintenance shall include the replacement of all dead plant material within the guaranteed contract period. Practices for proper maintenance of landscape materials shall be done in accordance with the following standards:
